# How To Implement Caching in Node.js Using Redis

## Introduction
Redis, an in-memory database that stores data in the server memory, is a popular tool to cache data. You can connect to Redis in Node.js using the node-redis module, which gives you methods to retrieve and store data in Redis.

In this tutorial, you’ll build an Express application that retrieves data from a RESTful API using the axios module. Next, you will modify the app to store the data fetched from the API in Redis using the node-redis module. After that, you will implement the cache validity period so that the cache can expire after a certain amount of time has passed. Finally, you will use the Express middleware to cache data.

## Prerequisites
To follow the tutorial, you will need:
- Node.js environment setup on your server. If you are on Ubuntu 22.04, install the latest version of Node.js and npm by following option 3 in How To Install Node.js on Ubuntu 22.04. For other operating systems, see the How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment series.
- Redis installed on your server. If you’re using Ubuntu 22.04, follow steps 1 and 2 of How To Install and Secure Redis on Ubuntu 22.04. If you’re working on another operating system, see How to Install and Secure Redis.
- Knowledge of asynchronous programming. Follow Understanding the Event Loop, Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await in JavaScript.
- Basic knowledge using the Express web framework. See How To Get Started with Node.js and Express.

## Steps
- Step 1 — Setting Up the Project
- Step 2 — Retrieving Data From a RESTful API Without Caching
- Step 3 — Caching RESTful API Requests Using Redis
- Step 4 — Implementing Cache Validity
- Step 5 — Caching Data in Middleware
